# Sign-Language-Classification-CNN

Ensure that numpy, matplotlib, keras, sklearn, and tensorflow are installed prior to running main.py

## Overview

The source file, main.py, implements a CNN with two convolutional layers, a fully connected layer, and an output layer. It utilizes a sign language [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset/version/1#Sign-language-digits-dataset.zip) from Kaggle. Additionally, some data augmentation is implemented to help the results generalize better. Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q7iY1rKYRVqemuqUahNqp1QSdiW08nZkMthukIrSS1g/edit?usp=sharing) to a presentation on our results.
